        <p id="p1">We are a part of the SMASH program on the UC Berkeley campus. It is a summer academy where we live, study, and sleep 5 weeks in dorms on campus, while attending classes.  In my Design Thinking class we are required to come up with a way to prevent a certain disease of our choice, and we chose STDs. The question we came up with to solve with our research is: How can we prevent STDs in teen living in the Bay Area? We hope to create a way to prevent STDs in teen living in the Bay Area.</p>
        <h3>QUESTIONS WE USED FOR INTERVIEWS:</h3>
        <p id="p2">
1. How long have you been studying STDs?<br>
2.  What is a way to prevent/stop this disease from affecting any more people?<br>
3. Do you know any specific information/statistics about STDs in teen living in the Bay Area?<br>
4. Do you have any personal experience with these type of diseases?<br>
5. When did you first hear about the effects of this disease?
