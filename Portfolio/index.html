        <p id="p1"> My life goal is to become a prestigious self-employed architect. I want to attend Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. My work experience allows me to become prepared for the responsibility of being an adult in the US.</p>

        <p id="p2">	I value my family very much. My family consists of my mom, dad, and my older sister. One of the reasons that I value my family is because they have all impacted my life and molded me into the person I am today. My mom has always encouraged me to never give up on my education and to always think about my and my family’s future. My dad has also encouraged me to be good person and to treat everyone with respect. My sister has always encouraged me to be myself and never pretend I’m someone I’m not. </p>

        <p id="p3">I value my education very much. I value my education very much because my education will essentially determine who I am when I become and adult. My education determines my social status and my opportunities. My education also determines how people see me as a person. My education will also determine my economic status in my future. Depending on how far I go with my education will determine how much money I make as an adult.</p>

	   <p id="p4">I very much value my friends. My friends are like a second family to me. Just like my real family, they have molded me into the person I am today. They always encourage me to be myself and always do everything to the best of my abilities. They also always check up on me and make sure I am emotionally stable.</p>
